This is my 'Coding Quiz' App! I spent long and arduous hours on it and am proud
of the outcome! The Application greets the 'User' with instructions and challenge
at the beginning page. Upon clicking 'Start Quiz' the games begin and the buttons and pages appear a disappear according to the 'Users' place in the quiz.

Every right answer is rewarded 20 points and every wrong answer is deducted -10.
Upon choosing and submitting the right answer the screen is wired to syncronize in a attribute change of background. When the 5 question test is complete the user is prompted to enter intials and presented with a score total and seconds remaining page. (if time runs out there is an alert that notifys 'time!') Also, the scores and seconds and points are stored in the local storage for later retrieval.

When the last page is arrived at there is an option to clear the score screen/local storage. I tried my best to @media query for several screens sizes(not the easiest feat!).
I enjoyed this process and learned a ton through trial and error! I ultimately have more ideas but will release this 'alpha' version 'CQ.1' until further updates reveal themselves! Here is a screenshot of the application and links...
